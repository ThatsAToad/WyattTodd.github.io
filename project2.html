									<h2>Ocean Guardian</h2>
									<p>Assigned with creating a game that raised awareness for any issue of our choosing, my group and I decided to create a board game focused on ocean cleanup, a lesser known issue killing our planet with many intricate problems and solutions.</p>

									<li>Challenge Designer/Revisor</li>

								<h2 align = "center">Research</h2>
								<p>Researching the things that are harming the ocean and potential solutions to them was imperative since our main goal was to raise awareness for ocean cleanup. While someone else in my group was tasked with
								researching specific ocean cleaup events, I helped research some of the alternate solutions for all of the challenges we wanted to tackle in our game, such as reducing sonar usage helping preserve coral reefs.</p>
								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Challenge & Action Designing</h2>
								<center><img src="images/pic03.jpg" width="1100" height="500"></center>

								<p>One of my  responsibilities was revising the initial drafts of the challenges and actions. After a few playtests, we learned that unstoppable challenges weren't fun and didn't fit thematically, so challenges 8 & 9 were removed.</p>
								<p>We also figured we should add more uses for the eco-point cards by allowing them to be used to mitigate the loss of certain challenge cards.</p>
								<p>The biggest issue with the intial drafts was that the challenges only had 1 action card that could solve it each. To make it so that you didn't have to reroll a lot or get really lucky, we made made multiple challenge cards solvable
								with as many action cards that made sense. Some action cards were also reworded so they could be used for those additional challenges.</p>
								<center><img src="images/pic02.jpg" width="1100" height="500"></center>
								<p>The revisions I made for the next draft of action & challenge cards served us very well as it only needed a few minor tweaks for the rest of development. The points were also redistributed to better reflect a healthier risk reward ratio.
								<br/>I was particularly happy with challenge 3, as it was the most satisfying to try and solve as it had such a high reward but an equally high risk to try to roll for since it only had 1 solution. Those who didn't want to roll weren't
								punished either since they could mitigate with a water.</p>
								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Card Design</h2>
								<p>As the one in charge of designing the cards, I opted for a layout that was simple but still provided all the necessary information on the front of the card in a way that was easy to understand.</p>
								<center><img src="images/pic01.jpg" width="1050" height="800"></center>
								<p>All card types have the back consist of the card typed out with the Ocean Guardian logo in the middle. The challenge cards were made blue to represent the ocean that is dealing with the challenges.<br/>
								The front of the challenge cards list all the necessary information on the front with the more important things like the challenge, solutions, and mitigations being the biggest. It also has some horizontal symmetry with the top & bottom</p>
								<center><img src="images/pic04.jpg" width="1050" height="800"></center>
								<p>The action cards were made orange since it is the complementary color of blue. The front only needed the card type/number and the action, so 90% of the space was dedicated to the action so more detailed descriptions could be written.</p>
								<center><img src="images/pic05.jpg" width="1050" height="800"></center>
								<p>The emergency spill cards were added during the last few playtests as a more specific and harder to solve challenge card that affected everybody, so the design remained the same as the challenge cards except colored red to give it a more urgent feel.</p>
								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Tabletop Simulator Designing</h2>
								<p>I was also in charge of creating a playable version of our board game on tabletop simulator for future playtests. It mostly required just porting textures and assets that my teammates & I made, but I also made some changes from what was originally discussed,
								such as making the eco tokens into eco cards because keeping track of 40+ water tokens would have been annoying. After every playtest, I needed to make any changes to the prototype and/or in game rulebook so that our next playtest can test changes immediately.</p>
								<center><img src="images/pic06.jpg" width="850" height="500"></center>
								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Playtesting and Rule Revising</h2>
								<p>While it wasn't discussed, I was unofficially assigned as the lead for playtests since I was the one making/changing the tabletop simulator so I could fill all the other playtesters on what changes were made easier.
								Our playtesting overall proved very useful and helped enhance our core gameplay loop</p>
								<h3>Main Improvements from Playtests</h3>
								<p><ul>
									<li>Recolored player tokens so they are not all yellow and are more distinguishable at a distance</li>
									<li>Recolored the eco point cards so that they are not all blue and make it easier to tell how many of what eco cards you have in your hands</li>
									<li>Reworded specific action card descriptions so they are more clear as to what problems they can solve</li>
									<li>Added net and pokey stick spaces to make the board more interesting and inflate the amount of eco points everyone gets </li>
									<li>Added a rule that everyone draws 1 action card when a challenge card is drawn so the game is more engaging (They cannot lose points, but they can still gain them if they can provide a valid solution)</li>
									<li>Added the mitigation section to the challenge cards to give resource cards more use</li>
									<li>Added a rule that gave any player that makes a round trip 3 clean water cards to reward players who roll high</li>
									<li>Added a rule that gave the decorative oil spill space functionality. It was a challenge that only had 1 solution, rewarded no points when solved, and affected everyone if no one could find a solution (other players could reroll for more action cards for emergency spills)</li>
								</ul></p>
								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Scriptwriting & Video Editing</h2>
								<p>As I was the only team member with some video making experience, I volunteered to make the video that would be "promoting" our game. I settled on a sort of training video that made it feel like the viewer was being trained to become
								an Ocean Guardian. Some humor was put in as fluff, but I kept the tone more serious because our oceans are in genuine need of our help, so I wanted to make sure people wouldn't think of ocean cleanup as a joke.
