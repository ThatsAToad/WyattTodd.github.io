									<h2>Ocean Guardian</h2>
									<p>Assigned with creating a game that raised awareness for any issue of our choosing, my group and I decided to create a board game focused on ocean cleanup, a lesser known issue killing our planet with many intricate problems and solutions.</p>

								<h2 align = "center">Research</h2>
								<p>Researching the things that are harming the ocean and potential solutions to them was imperative since our main goal was to raise awareness for ocean cleanup. While someone else in my group was tasked with
								researching specific ocean cleaup events, I helped research some of the alternate solutions for all of the challenges we wanted to tackle in our game, such as reducing sonar usage helping preserve coral reefs.</p>
								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Challenge & Action Designing</h2>
								<center><img src="/images/pic03.jpg" width="1100" height="500"></center>

								<p>One of my main responsibilities was revising the initial drafts of the challenges and actions that one of my team members made. After a few playtests, we figured that having unstoppable challenges was not fun as it was essentially just a giant
								middle finger to whoever was unlucky enough to draw it. This was further enforced by the decision to revise the rules so that every challenge had to be solved instead of the initial pitch of being the first to reach
								a certain amount of eco-points. Furthermore, having challenge 8 & 9 as they were would be essentially sending the message that, since it's already happened, there's nothing that can be done about it, which was a terrible
								message to send.
								<br />
								<p>During those playtests, we decided to add a way to mitigate the loss of a challenge card with a specific resource. For example, using a net to mitigate a loss since you could use that net to pick up plastic more efficiently in real life</p>
								<br />
								<p>Another issue I forsaw plaguing future playtests was the fact that every challenge only had a single solution. This would mean that you had an incredibly low chance of actually solving the solution unless you rerolled
								a lot. It ended up being an issue like I had predicted, so I went through all the challenges assigned multiple solutions to them while still keeping the theme on point. This was good timing, as I needed to rewrite all of the
								challenges as some were very poorly worded, too specific, or not specific enough. I also reassigned points based on a combination of how many solutions a challenge had, whether or not it could be mitigated, and the severity of
								it's impact on the oceans just to make it feel more balanced. </p>
								<center><img src="/images/pic02.jpg" width="1100" height="500"></center>
								<p>This new list of challenges and actions ended up being very good as future playtests revealed that they only required a few minor tweaks. I was especially happy with challenge 3, Radioactive Waste, as my decision to morph
								it into a high risk, high reward card ended up being really fun and satisfying. People who didn't want to gamble for the ~1/20 chance to get the only solution wouldn't be punished too hard for deciding not to participate, while
								those feeling lucky can use their resources to solve the challenge that gave by far the most points in the game while also not being completely ruined if their gamble doesn't pay off since they can mitigate the loss with a water.</p>
								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Card Design</h2>
								<p>As the one in charge of designing the cards, I opted for a layout that was simple but still provided all the necessary information on the front of the card in a way that was easy to understand.</p>
								<center><img src="/images/pic01.jpg" width="1050" height="800"></center>
								<p>For all of the card types, I opted for a simple text on top, game logo, text on bottom since every type of card only had 2 words. For the challenge cards, I decided to make them blue to match the color of the ocean. 
								As for the front, the card type and number are at the top and relatively small because it isn't the most important information on the front. The challenge, howver, is the most important, so I made it the focal point of the entire
							    card. The solutions and mitigations are also important and both give valid responses to the card, so they were put next to each other below the challenge and scaled down a bit while still being much bigger than everything that isn't
								the challenge. Lastly, the eco points at stake were put on the very bottom in a way that it gave the card a bit of symmetry.</p>
								<center><img src="/images/pic04.jpg" width="1050" height="800"></center>
								<p>For the action cards, I decided to color them orange as it is the complementary color of blue. I felt that using the complementary color more enforced a problem solution dynamic between the two types of cards. As for the front, there were
								only 2 sections that were needed as opposed to the 5 that the challenge card required. Action cards only needed the type of card & its number at the top to match the challenge card and the action that will be performed to solve the challenge.
								As such, designating the 90% of the space unused by the card type/number looked the best. The large amount of space designated to the action was also a necessity in some instances, as some actions, such as #3, had an incredibly long description
								that would have required a smaller font size if it wasn't given the ample space it needed.</p>
								<center><img src="/images/pic05.jpg" width="1050" height="800"></center>
								<p>The emergency spill cards were added during the last few playtests as a more specific and harder to solve challenge card that affected everybody, so the design remained the same as the challenge cards except colored red to give it a more urgent feel.</p>
								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Tabletop Simulator Designing</h2>
								<p>I was also in charge of creating a playable version of our board game on tabletop simulator for future playtests. It mostly required just porting textures and assets that my teammates made, but I also made some changes from what was originally discussed,
								such as making the eco tokens into eco cards because keeping track of 40+ water tokens would have been annoying. After every playtest, I needed to make any changes to the prototype and/or in game rulebook so that our next playtest can test changes immediately.</p>
								<center><img src="/images/pic06.jpg" width="850" height="500"></center>
								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Playtesting and Rule Revising</h2>
								<p>While it wasn't discussed, I was unofficially assigned as the lead for playtests since I was the one making/changing the tabletop simulator so I could fill all the other playtesters on what changes were made easier.
								Our playtesting overall proved very useful and helped enhance our core gameplay loop</p>
								<h3>Main Improvements from Playtests</h3>
								<p><ul>
									<li>Recolored player tokens so they are not all yellow and are more distinguishable at a distance</li>
									<li>Recolored the eco point cards so that they are not all blue and make it easier to tell how many of what eco cards you have in your hands</li>
									<li>Reworded specific action card descriptions so they are more clear as to what problems they can solve</li>
									<li>Added net and pokey stick spaces to make the board more interesting and inflate the amount of eco points everyone gets </li>
									<li>Added a rule that everyone draws 1 action card when a challenge card is drawn so the game is more engaging (They cannot lose points, but they can still gain them if they can provide a valid solution)</li>
									<li>Added the mitigation section to the challenge cards to give resource cards more use</li>
									<li>Added a rule that gave any player that makes a round trip 3 clean water cards to reward players who roll high</li>
									<li>Added a rule that gave the decorative oil spill space functionality. It was a challenge that only had 1 solution, rewarded no points when solved, and affected everyone if no one could find a solution (other players could reroll for more action cards for emergency spills)</li>
								</ul></p>
								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Scriptwriting & Video Editing</h2>
								<p>As I was the only team member with some video making experience, I volunteered to make the video that would be "promoting" our game. I settled on a sort of training video that made it feel like the viewer was being trained to become
								an Ocean Guardian. Some humor was put in as fluff, but I kept the tone more serious because our oceans are in genuine need of our help, so I wanted to make sure people wouldn't think of ocean cleanup as a joke.
