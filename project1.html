									<h2>Nature's Gift</h2>
									<p>Inspired by the "Bash" ability from Ori and the Blind Forest, I set out to make a 3d platformer that had its interesting movement mechanics tied to interacting with the enemies in the level.</p>

								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Research</h2>
								<p>I took an in depth look at what made bash so satisfying in Ori and came to the conclusion that the process of gaining a significant amount of momentum from interacting with enemies was what made it so fun. Sure the game
								could have just given you a mid-air dash and called it a day, but the fact that you have to manouver through the air to reach an enemy to use your best movement tool was incredibly satisfying.<br/><br/>
								Another game that sort of does this is Celeste with their dash-recharging gem. While it isn't quite as satisfying as bash is (in my opinion), dashing through a gem to recharge your only movement tool so you can cover more distance is also
								incredibly satisfying. 
								</p>
								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Initial Design</h2>
								<center><img src="images/pic07.jpg" width="800" height="500"></center>
								<p>I wanted the game to be a non-fantasy 3D platformer that took place in the forest. I decided to make the "enemies" that you would jump off of be birds because of how silly it sounded, especially since the title of the game was Nature's Gift.</p>
								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Core Game Mechanics</h2>
								<p>The initial plan was to give the player a stored jump when they touched the bird (placeholder was a cube), but I pivoted into designing it so that you can only get an extra jump/dash if you are within range of the bird. This also made it more like the bash from Ori.</p>
								<center><img src="images/pic08.jpg" width="800" height="500"></center>
								<p>In total, I designed 4 birds:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Blue Birds: Allows the player to jump off them for extra height & distance. The most common type of bird throughout the game.</li><center><img src="images/pic12.jpg" width="300" height="300"></center>
									<li>Red Birds: Same as blue birds except they hurt you when you jump off them. Used to restrict certain paths if the player took an easier route earlier this section. Remaining health is represented by the falcon bar in the top left of the screen.</li><center><img src="images/pic13.jpg" width="300" height="300"></center>
									<li>Green Birds: Allows the player to dash in the direction they're looking at great speeds. Factors in momentum for extra speed. The most fun bird to jump off of and the main focus of most sections.</li><center><img src="images/pic14.jpg" width="300" height="300"></center>
									<li>Orange Birds: Same as the blue birds except they move in a fixed pattern. Used to add an element of timing during attempts.</li><center><img src="images/pic15.jpg" width="300" height="300"></center>
								</ul>
								The original plan was to make each of these birds a specific type of bird (such as red birds being hawks), but that was outside the scope for this game so I settled for just making them easily distinguishable via their colors.</p>
								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Level Design - Tutorial Level</h2>
								<p>The tutorial level was made around pre-placed trees throughout the level. This ended up restricting what I could make, but since the tutorial level wasn't intended to be incredibly difficult, it was fine.<br/>
								<center><img src="images/pic09.jpg" width="850" height="500"></center>
								The level introduces each type of bird (except orange) in a simple platforming section before ramping up the difficulty using the knowledge of the new bird in the next section. Its designed to ease the player into the mechanics
								without being incredibly hand holdy while also not being a complete cakewalk.<br/>
								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Level Design - Main Level</h2>
								<p>The main level was designed by placing trees where I wanted them to be so I could design more intricate and fun platforming sections. I also scaled up the level by quite a bit to make failing a section feel more impactful.</p>
								<center><img src="images/pic10.jpg" width="850" height="500"></center>
								<p>The level quickly introduces the last bird type and then makes full use of all of them for the rest of the sections. The rest of the sections make heavy use of green's momentum boost. There are checkpoints after every 2 sections so the player
								doesn't lose too much progress if they fail any particular section. The exception is the last chunk where it is comparatively simpler to serve as a way for the player to get closer to the ominous cluster of trees in the middle of the forest.<br/></p>

								<hr />
								<h2 align = "center">Ending</h2>
								<center><img src="images/pic11.jpg" width="850" height="500"></center>
								<p>The final big bird boss fight was included as a way to end the game without it feeling too sudden while also allowing it to showcase just how silly and nonsensical the game concept is. It also was an excuse to put as many green birds as humanly possible.<br/>
								Overall, I'm quite happy with this game. Although I have a ways to go, I'm quite proud of it considering it was my first attempt at a full game.
